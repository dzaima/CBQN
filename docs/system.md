# CBQN-specific system values and extensions

## `‚Ä¢term`

`‚Ä¢term.OutRaw` and `‚Ä¢term.ErrRaw` output the given bytes directly to the specific stream, without any trailing newline. May be removed once a proper interface for stream I/O has been made.

## `‚Ä¢GetLine`

Ignores its argument and returns one line of stdin.

Might be removed, moved, or renamed in the future.

## `‚Ä¢Hash`

Get the hash of `ùï©`.

Monadically, use the global secret value which will differ between CBQN sessions.

Dyadically, use the integer left argument as the seed. Will be the same between multiple CBQN sessions, but may change between CBQN versions.

## `‚Ä¢Cmp`

Compare arguments. Equal to `((‚äë‚çã-‚çí)‚ãà)`.

## `‚Ä¢FromUTF8`

Convert the argument UTF-8 byte array (or character array consisting of codepoints 0-255) to a string.

May be removed or renamed in the future.

## `‚Ä¢ToUTF8`

Convert the argument character list to a UTF-8-encoded byte array, represented as a list of characters with codepoints 0-255.

May be removed or renamed in the future.

## `‚Ä¢CurrentError`

Get the current error message while within the catch side of `‚éä`. Dynamically-scoped.

Argument must not be a namespace, as that is reserved for future changes.

## `‚Ä¢internal`

Namespace of various internal functions. May change at any time.

| name                       | description |
|----------------------------|-------------|
| `‚Ä¢internal.GC`             | Run a garbage collection cycle |
| `‚Ä¢internal.Type`           | Name of the internal type for an object |
| `‚Ä¢internal.ObjFlags`       | Monadically, get the flags of `ùï©`. Dyadically, set the flags of `ùï©` to `ùï®`. |
| `‚Ä¢internal.ElType`         | Element size type identifier; see `enum ElType` |
| `‚Ä¢internal.Keep`           | Require the argument to stay alive up to this point in the program. Returns the argument, but without signaling to possible optimizations that the input and output will be equal |
| `‚Ä¢internal.PureKeep`       | `‚Ä¢internal.Keep` but marked as a pure function |
| `‚Ä¢internal.Refc`           | Reference count of the argument, if it's heap-allocated |
| `‚Ä¢internal.IsPure`         | Whether the vm considers the argument pure (i.e. it can execute it safely for computing fills) |
| `‚Ä¢internal.Info`           | General internal info about the object; a left argument of `1` gives more details |
| `‚Ä¢internal.HeapDump`       | Create a heap dump file; saves to `‚Ä¢wdpath`-relative path `ùï©` or `CBQNHeapDump` if `ùï©` isn't an array |
| `‚Ä¢internal.HeapStats`      | If argument is `@`, returns `‚ü®total heap size ‚ãÑ used heap size‚ü©`. If argument is a string, prints the equivalent of `)mem the-string` |
| `‚Ä¢internal.HasFill`        | Returns whether the argument has a fill element (may give `0` even if `1‚Üë0‚•äùï©` doesn't error in some CBQN configurations) |
| `‚Ä¢internal.Squeeze`        | Try to convert the argument to its most compact representation |
| `‚Ä¢internal.DeepSqueeze`    | Try to convert the argument and all its subarrays to its most compact representation; won't squeeze namespace fields |
| `‚Ä¢internal.ListVariations` | List the possible type variations of the argument array |
| `‚Ä¢internal.Variation`      | Convert `ùï©` to the variation specified in `ùï®` |
| `‚Ä¢internal.ClearRefs`      | Clear references `‚Ä¢internal.Variation` made for `*Inc` variations |
| `‚Ä¢internal.Unshare`        | Get a unique, reference count 1 version of the argument; recursively unshares array items, doesn't touch namespaces |
| `‚Ä¢internal.EEqual`         | exactly equal (NaN equals NaN, 0 equals ¬Ø0) |
| `‚Ä¢internal.Temp`           | place to test new features or temporarily expose some internal function |
| `‚Ä¢internal.Properties`     | various build properties |

# FFI

Currently there is no support for nested pointers, and limited support of structs.

That is, the supported types are:
- scalars (e.g. `i8`, `u64`);
- pointers to scalars (e.g. `*i8`, `&u64`);
- conversions of either scalars, pointers to scalars, or opaque pointers (e.g. `u64:i32`, `*i64:i32`, `*:i8`, `**:c8`);
- arrays of scalars or structs (e.g. `[2]i32`, `[4]{i32,i32}`);
- structs of any of the above (except `&`-pointers) or other structs (e.g. `{*i8,*{*u32:i8,u64:i32}}`), except structs that are within `&` themselves cannot contain any pointers other than converted opaque pointers (e.g. `*{*i32,u64}`, `&{*:i32,u64}`, and `&{i32,u64}` are fine, but `&{*i32,u64}` is not);
- the `a` type, which maps to `BQNV` from [bqnffi.h](../include/bqnffi.h) (example usage in [FFI tests](../test/ffi/)).

# `‚Ä¢SH`

The left argument can be a namespace, providing additional options.

Accepted fields:

- `stdin‚áê"abcd"` passes in stdin to the program; by default, it will be UTF-8 encoded.
- `raw‚áê1` will make stdout/stderr return raw bytes (represented as characters with codepoints 0 to 255), and, if given, interpret stdin as such too.

```bqn
   ¬Ø1‚Üì1‚äë{stdin‚áê@+20‚Äø100‚Äø200‚Äø250,raw‚áê1} ‚Ä¢SH ‚ü®"xxd"‚ü©
"00000000: 1464 c8fa                                .d.."
   @-Àú 1‚äë{raw‚áê1} ‚Ä¢SH ‚ü®"printf", "\x00\x80\xff\xfe\xee"‚ü©
‚ü® 0 128 255 254 238 ‚ü©
```


These `‚Ä¢SH` extensions may change in the future if a different interface is standardized.
